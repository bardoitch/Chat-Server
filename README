EX4 - Chat Server

This program implement a simple chat server using TCP protocol.
The server can talk with many clients, each on a different socket. 

*So how it's work?(client view)
A client sends a connection request to port and the socket server listening to that port accepts it.
After the server accepts a client request, a connection is established and this client can send chat messages to all the other clients whose connected.
All the other clients whose connected accept this message and can know who sent it by the guest id.

*(server view)
The server waits for clientsâ€™ request. Once the server reads a message from the client, it reads it till a new line appears.
The server gets a message from the client and send it to all clients except the one who sends it.
